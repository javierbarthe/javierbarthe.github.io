I"3<p>I started my first job in 2009 as a software engineer in a database team for monitoring DBMS and graphing metrics related to its performance. After a while I become a full time DBA, administering transactional/warehousing systems and coding all related monitoring shell scripts. Now after 10 years, passionate about data and all challenges related to, I continue my data journey.</p>
